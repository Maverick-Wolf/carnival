# carnival

+ This is a basic shopping application made using Flutter.

### What all new stuff i learned

+ This app uses SliverAppBar (app bar the disappears when scrolling) so learned to implement that, *was not easy*
+ Learned how to use FutureBuilder in Sliver List
+ Learned how to use staggered grid view so the page where all the products are diplayed have grids of variying size according to the height of the product image
+ Learned how to use "Hero" to keep the product image always the point of focus when changing pages => *productList to productDescription page swap*
+ Learned about "Visibility" to hide a widget from the screen when not needed
+ Learned how to use a ListView inside AppBar and make it act like a TopNavigationBar
+ So all in all tried making the UI/UX similar to the Pinterest App
